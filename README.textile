This is a simple TextMate bundle which can help deal with Colloquy's incomprehensible backlog copy-and-paste output. At least, I think it does. I use it with the "DecafBland" style. I'm not sure if it works the same with other styles.

h3. Installation

bc. cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/
git clone git://github.com/raws/colloquy-tmbundle.git Colloquy.tmbundle
osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

h3. Usage

The bundle contains two handy commands.

|_. Command |_. Shortcut |_. Description |
| Format Quote | ⇧⌘I | Reformat the selected text to resemble a sane IRC log. |
| Paste and Format Quote | ^⌘I | Reformat the clipboard contents to resemble a sane IRC log. |
